## 1) How can it be installed?

Found the export `Install` in the DLL. Ran the following command:

```powershell
rundll32.exe Lab03-02.dll, Install
```

Ran RegShot before and after, then compared. The results show that a service named `IPRIP` 
was added, specifically the new registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\IPRIP.`

````

Verified that the service was installed using `psservice`:

```powershell
psservice query IPRIP

SERVICE_NAME: IPRIP
DISPLAY_NAME: Intranet Network Awareness (INA+)
Depends INA+, Collects and stores network configuration and location information, and notifies applications when this information changes.
        TYPE              : 20 WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS
        STATE             : 1  STOPPED
                               (NOT_STOPPABLE,NOT_PAUSABLE,IGNORES_SHUTDOWN)
        WIN32_EXIT_CODE   : 1077 (0x435)
        SERVICE_EXIT_CODE : 0  (0x0)
        CHECKPOINT        : 0x0
        WAIT_HINT         : 0 ms
```


## 2) How would it be run after installation?


Started the service with the following command:

```powershell
net start IPRIP

    The Intranet Network Awareness (INA+) service is starting.
    The Intranet Network Awareness (INA+) service was started successfully.
```


## 3) How can the process be found?

Had Process Explorer running when the service started. Searched for the string `Lab03` 
in Process Explorer, and came up with the process svchost.exe (PID:1056). This 
instance of svchost.exe is also hosting other services, as evidenced by hovering 
over the process in Process Explorer.


## 4) Filters for ProcMon?

Created a Process Monitor filter using the PID (1056) found in Process Explorer.


## 5) Host based indicators?
	
1. The DLL itself.
2. The IPRIP service (and associated registry keys).


## 6) Network based indicators?

1. DNS queries for `practicalmalwareanalysis.com`
2. HTTP GET requests to `practicalmalwareanalysis.com/serve.html`
3. HTTP request with user agent that includes the string`Windows XP 6.11`
4. Packets to `80/tcp` that match the periodic transmissions' unchanging payload bytes.


The service sends a DNS requests for `practicalmalwareanalysis.com`.

Service sends a single HTTP GET request for `/serve.html`. The user agent was the system's 
hostname followed by`Windows XP 6.11`," a hardcoded string in the binary. Inetsim 
responds with default HTML response.

Service then sends some small (54-62 byte) packets to `80/tcp`, of what look like random 
data. Each packet is only slightly different, and always in the same location. Custom 
protocol?


The service does this at regular intervals.
Identifying itself to a botnet as a zombie?
